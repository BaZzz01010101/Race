# Race

This is just an attempt to solve the [problem](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/671/E?locale=en) which very few people was able to complete.

[Here](http://codeforces.com/contest/671/status/E/page/1?order=BY_CONSUMED_TIME_ASC&locale=en) is the results table. My nick name is "zeus8" there.

My solution was not fastest but had the lowest memory usage.
It based on sequential pushing race finish and pulling start with cumulative computations and minimizing recalculations.
